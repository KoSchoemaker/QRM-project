# QRM-project
Using TIHM dataset, try to figure out to what extend routine influences sleep quality

## Setup
In the dataset folder, paste the unzipped dataset csv files which can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/7622128).

## Directories
- the *intermediate_results* folder contains json files with some results that can be used for further analysis. This exists so not all code has to be ran to do some further analysis (running all code may take quite some time!).
- *figures* contains figures of interesting patterns seen in the data
- *old* contains deprecated code files that are not used for the final main analysis, but was used in the process.
